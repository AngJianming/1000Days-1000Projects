# Start running node.js | IN 5 STEPS

1) ```npm init``` - To create a Node project, then just click `Enter` in your keyboard.<br>

This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
