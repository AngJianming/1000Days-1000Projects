# 1000 Days of 1000 JavaScript(JS) Projects

Welcome to the **1000 Days of 1000 JavaScript Projects** repository! This is an ambitious journey to complete 1000 JavaScript projects in 1000 days, where each day brings a new project focused on enhancing JavaScript skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities.<br>

This repo consists some Node.js which is a server side JavaScript engine from chrome that can compile JavaScript into machine code for efficient execution. Not only that, but also frameworks like Next.js, React.js, Vue.js and Angular.js might also be included with some js libraries.
